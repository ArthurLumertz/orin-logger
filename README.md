# Orin Logger
the orin logger is a lightweight and fast logger inspired by log4j made for performance intensive tasks but with some minimal customization.

# How to use
its header-only library, meaning you only have to move the `orinlogger.hpp` file into the source of your C++ project

## Code Example
```c++

/**

**/
#define ORIN_TIME_IMPLEMENTATION

#include "orinlogger.hpp"
```
